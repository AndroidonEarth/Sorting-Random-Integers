# Sorting Random Integers
MASM Assembly program that uses procedures to generate and sort random integers. Uses the Kip Irvine library for x86 processors.

- First generates random numbers in the range of 100 to 999. 
- The program then displays the original list, sorts the list, and calculates the median value. 
- Finally, it displays the new sorted list in decending order. 
- The program is constructed using procedures and parameters are passed by value or by reference on the system stack.
